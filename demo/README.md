# Discrete Math meets Deep Learning

YouTube has a silent
but [animated version](https://youtu.be/lW_ExV1yGL8) of
the
[slides](https://elisa.dyndns-web.com/teaching/mat/discretas/ejemplos/demo.pdf);
remember that you can use the controls to slow it down or speed it up
to your liking. I will link the video of the lecture here if I secure
permission to record or stream it (not up to me to decide that this
time, sorry).

## Python code

You can fiddle with the [Python
source](https://github.com/satuelisa/DiscreteMath/blob/master/demo/demo.py)
to play with the code on a stand-alone Python installation or the
[Jupyter
notebook](https://github.com/satuelisa/DiscreteMath/blob/master/demo/demo.ipynb)
to just see what it does or to explore ways to improve it (the latter
has a bit more explanations of the steps). You can [interact with
it](https://colab.research.google.com/github/satuelisa/DiscreteMath/blob/master/demo/demo.ipynb)
online as well.

## Gnuplot files

Those `plot` and `dat` files are for making plots of the solution quality
of SA and epoch accuracy of DL with [Gnuplot](http://gnuplot.sourceforge.net/).
