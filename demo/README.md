# A case study on discrete math
## Solving TSP based on an MST

YouTube has a silent
but [animated version](https://youtu.be/6Bny3BDw500) of
the
[slides](https://github.com/satuelisa/DiscreteMath/blob/master/demo/demo.pdf);
remember that you can use the controls to slow it down or speed it up
to your liking. I will link the video of the lecture here if I secure
permission to record or stream it (not up to me to decide that this
time, sorry).

You can fiddle with
the
[Python source](https://github.com/satuelisa/DiscreteMath/blob/master/demo/demo.py) to
play with the code on a stand-alone Python installation or
the
[Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/satuelisa/DiscreteMath/blob/master/demo/demo.ipynb) to
just see what it does or to explore ways to improve it (the latter has
a bit more explanations of the steps). You can [interact with it](https://colab.research.google.com/github/satuelisa/DiscreteMath/blob/master/demo/demo.ipynb) online as well.


The last two files are for making that plot of the solution quality of
the simulated annealing step:
the
[data](https://github.com/satuelisa/DiscreteMath/blob/master/demo/improvement.dat) and
the
[Gnuplot script](https://github.com/satuelisa/DiscreteMath/blob/master/demo/improvement.plot).
