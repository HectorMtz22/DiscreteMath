Working with a TSP of 8 cities
The minimum single-edge cost is 0.66 and the maximum is 0.66
The cheapest (exhaustive) route edgecosts 2.89
That took 46 ms of runtime
The cheapest (pruned) route edgecosts 2.89
That took 22 ms of runtime
The cheapest random walk edgecosts 3.29 (over 30 attempts)
That took 0 ms of runtime
The minimum spanning tree edgecosts 2.13
That took 0 ms of runtime
